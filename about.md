## About this Development
Creek Road Ranch is a semi-rural, residential development a few miles southwest of downtown Dripping Springs, where Blue Creek joins Onion Creek. Creek Road is one of the most charming areas of the Texas Hill Country. The average lot size is 4 acres/homesite, with individual lots ranging from 2 acres to 17.7 acres. Park land provides every resident direct access to Blue Creek and Onion Creek, and a private park on Onion Creek is available to all residents. Scenic buffer easements permanently protect sensitive hillsides from development. This development will be a special place for families to enjoy the Texas Hill Country and also live very near to Austin.

## Conservation Development
Creek Road Ranch is a Conservation Development. We offer homeowners a sense of living in the country while benefiting from features of subdivision. For example, we have clustered homesites on the propertyâ€™s plateaus, while limiting construction in its meadows. This planning method will protect the rural character of Creek Road. Sensitive environmental zones along creeks and hillsides are restricted against future development. Protective covenants insure that homeowners will continue to enjoy the property after the neighborhood has been completed.
